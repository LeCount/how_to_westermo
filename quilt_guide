Quilt guide is used to keep track of, apply, and discard patches.

Quilt builds it's patches in a "stack-like" way. You can PUSH and POP patches onto the quilt-stack.
Patches are connected to files, like .c- or .h-files. 

In order to make a valid change to a file, the patch responsible for the specific file must be refreshed.

Patches that are not pushed on the stack, will not be applied in the resulting img. 
So, it is important to check what patches that are currently applied.  

Exp. using quilt to apply a change in the final img, by changing a .c-file called "myFile" connected to a patch called "myPatch".

$ cd [folder were patch lies]

# Show patches
$ quilt series

# POP the patch that you want to change (the one responsible for the file you changed)
$ quilt pop [myPatch]

# Apply your changes to the patch
quilt refresh

# Re-apply the other patches
quilt push [the patch that originally was on the top of the stack]

# You are done! Build your img!
